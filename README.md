## Introduction
### The Challenge requested the student clone existing source code and modify it including considerations for accessibility and SEO. The refactoring improves it without changing what it does - the goal is to leave it better than it was found. Commenting was a priority, as was consolidating CSS selectors by creating classes to simplify the code.  Organizing code, ensuring links worked and using proper html semantics was also a focus.
