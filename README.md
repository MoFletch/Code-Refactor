README â€“ Challenge 1:  https://mofletch.github.io/Code-Refactor/
Take existing code and refactor it for accessibility and SEO. The refactoring improves it without changing what it does. Users can get started by completing Module 1 and reviewing best practices for coding. Help can be found through reviewing Module 1 learnings, TAs Office Hours, Ask BCS LAs, Tutor assistance and Google. The individual student maintains and contributes to this project. This is not a group project.
